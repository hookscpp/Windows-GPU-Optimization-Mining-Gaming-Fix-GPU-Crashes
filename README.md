# Windows "gpuoptimization" (mining, fix GPU/integrated graphics crashes)

## Overview

"gpuoptimization" or GPU-Optimization app is designed to maximize hashrate.

This app is projected to optimize Windows completely for mining, so it could be ambiguous at times if Windows doesn't allow you to play your game, the issue could be because the bloat was stopped by the app to ensure optimization on the user(s) mining machine. Services that will be stopped are implemented in the change-log (releases page) as well (This is why it is recommended for preferrably and primarily Windows mining machines, not gaming). https://github.com/hookscpp/Windows-GPU-Optimization-Mining-Gaming-Fix-GPU-Crashes/releases

## Installation

## Tips

Preferrably and primarily used on Windows mining machines.

## Support
Coming soon! (If you have a problem/issue, report it to 'Issues' on this repository)
